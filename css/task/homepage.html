        <p>A home page (or homepage) is the main web page of a website.[1] The term may also refer to the start page shown in a web browser when the application first opens.[2] Usually, the home page is located at the root of the website's domain or subdomain. For example, if the domain is example.com, the home page is likely located at www.example.com/.Function.A home page is the primary web page that a visitor will view when they navigate to a website via a search engine, and it may also function as a landing page to attract visitors.[3] In some cases, the home page is a site directory, particularly when a website has multiple home pages.Good home page design is usually a high priority for a website;[4] for example, a news website may curate headlines and first paragraphs of top stories, with links to full articles.[5][6] According to Homepage Usability, the homepage is the "most important page on any website" and receives the most views of any page.[7] A poorly designed home page can overwhelm and deter visitors from the site.[6] One important use of home pages is communicating the identity and value of a company.[8]Elements.A homepage is oftentimes designed to catch attention, and as such, important elements are positioned at the top in a strict hierarchy of importance.[9] Curating which content to display on a homepage, as to not overwhelm visitors, is important to a well-designed page.Hero image One of the commonly found aspects of a homepage is a hero image, a large eye-catching banner image often containing a photograph or drawing depicting the webpage owner's values, services, etc. as a message.[11][12] Hero images are immediately visible above the fold, without scrolling the page down.[13] A hero image may have several complementary elements as an overlay, such as the website's logo, a call to action, and a brief description.</p>
